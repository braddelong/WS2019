    "One (relatively minor) conclusion from Olivier Blanchard's excellent, thoughtful, and provocative American Economic Association Presidential Address \"Public Debt and Low Interest Rates\" <https://www.aeaweb.org/aea/2019conference/program/pdf/14020_paper_etZgfbDr.pdf> is that, in the near-canonical Diamond (1965) Overlapping-Generations model he considers, whether a marginal increase in public debt raises welfare—whether an economy is \"dynamically inefficient\"—depends not just on the relationship of the rate of interest on safe government bonds to the growth rate but on both that interest rate's and the expected rate of profit's relationship to the economy's growth rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, one important effect—perhaps the principal effect—of government debt is to directly shift consumption away from the young who buy the debt to use it as a savings vehicle and to the old who hold and sell the debt and . I follow and agree with Blanchard’s correct conclusion that this direct-transfer effect can be welfare-raising or welfare-lowering. It will be welfare-raising as long as the economy is dynamically-inefficient, defined as having its safe rate of interest is less than its growth rate. So far, so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this near-canonical model, a second effect springs from government debt’s potential role in crowding-out capital investment. To the extent that it does so, and to the extent with that crowding-out raises profits received by old wealthholders and diminishes wages earned by younger workers, this second factor-price effect can also be welfare-raising or welfare-lowering: it also transfers from the young, who earn less in wages, to the old, whose profits are increased because the firms they own pay less in wages. It will be welfare-raising, Blanchard concludes in his presidential address, only under a stronger condition than that required for the direct-transfer effect: not just the safe rate of interest on government bonds but the risky rate of profit on capital investment must be lower than the economy’s growth rate.\n",

    "## <font color=\"880000\"> Robert Waldmann: Dynamic Inefficiency</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a world with no stochastic shocks, there is dynamic efficiency so long as the profit and safe interest rate $ R > 1 + g $.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ 1 + g > R $, there is dynamic inefficiency, in the sense that a Pareto improvement can be achieved through a reduction in the stock of capital. Simply have the government issue and then rollover debt, and spend the money on useful things. In the semi-canonical Diamond model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the money is distributed to all, that is a Pareto improvement. \n",
    "2. Agents have expanded opportunities—they can, when young, invest in debt rather than lower-yielding capital, and that is a second Pareto improvement. \n",
    "3. Moreover, the reduction in the captial stock shifts factor prices toward profits received by the old and away from wages received by the young, which is a Diamond-model Pareto improvement as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when there is a wedge between the (risky) rate of profit $ R $ and the (safe) rate of interest $ R^f $ there are at least two real interest rates. Which of these rates matters for dynamic inefficiency? This matters, for, as noted by Blanchard, in the United States typically the safe interest rate $ R^f $ has been less than $ 1 + g $, but the risky profit rate $ R $ has been greater than $ 1 + g $. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that it is the safe rate that matters. The presence of a profit rate $ R > 1 + g $ along with an interest rate $ 1 + g > R^f $ means that achieving a Pareto improvement via a reduction in the capital stock is not trivially simple—as it is in the no-wedge case—but such a policy exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, assume trend growth $ g = 0 $. Furthermore, assume $ {R^f}_t < 1 $ for every t. (Note that this is a strong assumption: $ R^f $ varies with the capital stock $ K $, and this requires that there be no state of the world in which the capital stock is so low that the economy becomes—temporarily—dynamically efficient.) Consider a government that issues and rollsover debt $ D $, paying each period's safe rate $ {R^f}_t < 0 $, and taxes or transfers to keep D constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since $ {R^f}_t < 1 $ for all t, the state transfers wealth to its citizens each period—a Pareto improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Moreover, $ D $ crowds out K, so there is reduced production. Consumers lose $ {R_t}{\\Delta}K_t $, where $ {\\Delta}K $ is the reduction in $ K $ due to $ D $, and gain $ {R^f}_tD $. Since they have a revealed preference for $ {R^f}_tD $, this is a Pareto improvement as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. However, as Blanchard stresses, this reduction $ {\\Delta}K $ in the capital stock also has a general equilibrium effect on factor prices: a higher rate of profit $ r $ and lower wages $ W $. Blanchard demonstrates that the sign of this effect on the welfare evaluated after the resolution of period t-1 uncertainty but before thje resolution of period t uncertainty of the median generation which works with median K using median technology is the same as the sign of: $ E_{t-1}(R_t - 1) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this third effect that leads Blanchard to conclude that dynamic inefficiency depends not just on the (safe) interest rate relative to the growth rate but also on the (risky) profit rate relative to the growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is correct if the only policy levers available to the government are the issuing and redemption of debt and associated lump-sum taxes and transfers. However, if the state can also impose a profits tax and a wage subsidy, then the third effect exists only if its existence pleases the government. If the existence of this general-equilibrium factor-price effect does not please the government, it can neutralize it. It is a feasible (balanced budget) tax-and-transfer policy to ensure that citizens face the same $ W_t $ and $ R_t $ that they would have faced under zero-debt laissez-faire. In this case effects (1) and (2) are still present: citizens still get a subsidy each period, and citizens still have access to a high-value safe saving vehicle in which they chose to invest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Pareto improvement associated with a reduced capital stock. The existence of this Pareto improvement shows that a sufficient condition for dynamic inefficiency is $ {R^f}_t < 0 $ for all t.\n",

    "Robert's point is that the government can issue debt, thus doing a partial-equilibrium direct-transfer effect (1) and a general-equilibrium factor-price effect (3), and also do (4) to neutralize the (3).

    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also something that I am confused about: Olivier does his welfare analysis from the standpoint of a generation young in period t after period-t uncertainty has been resolved. From that standpoint (3) and (4) involve a certain transfer from or to the young in period t, and an uncertain transfer to or from the old in period t+1, and thus are appropriately discounted at the risky interest rate. But from behind the veil of ignorance, all parts of (3) and (4) are correlated with lifetime wealth, and it is my intuition—which I have not been able to math up—that the appropriate discount rate should be somewhere between $ R^f $ and $ R $ here...\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the following point: the gap between $ R^f $ and $ R $  in the world is not a rational representative agent's discount for risk. The gap is as wide as it is in the real world because of (a) financial market frictions, including (b) the fact that index funds are not yet the marginal investor, that these days you need not 10 but 50 individual stocks to be diversified, and thus that bsnkruptcy-fearing holders of individual stocks do not extend themselves in equities. If one had a model in which the factors of production were labor, capital, and risk-bearing capacity, then the natural conclusion would be that dynamic efficiency depends on $ R^f $ alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the fact that Diamond (1965) is only semi-canonical. Olivier said at lunch—with the eyes of the smart young whippersnapper Ben Schoeffer (Ph.D. Harvard 2005), who had never been taken through the Diamond model in lecture, glazing over as we talked—that his estimate was that only 1 in 4 recent Ph.D.'s were taught the Diamond model. For the other 3 in 4, it is all Ramsey—and, of course, for Ramsey with a representative agent there is nothing that a government can do that the RA cannot, and so dynamic inefficiency is simply impossible as no rational RA would ever hold too much capital.\n",

However, from a broader social-welfare perspective the risky interest rate as of time t $ E_t(R_{t+1}) = \\frac{{\\alpha}F({\\beta}W_t)}{{\\beta}W_t} $ is itself stochastic—a function of all those previous $ \\epsilon $ shocks up to time t that determine $ Y_t $ both directly and by feeding into the value of $ K_t $.
