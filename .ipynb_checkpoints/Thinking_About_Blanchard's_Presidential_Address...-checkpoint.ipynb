    "One major conclusion from Olivier Blanchard's excellent, thoughtful, and provocative American Economic Association Presidential Address \"Public Debt and Low Interest Rates\" <https://www.aeaweb.org/aea/2019conference/program/pdf/14020_paper_etZgfbDr.pdf> is that whether a marginal increase in public debt raise welfare—whether an economy is \"dynamically inefficient\"—depends on the relationship of both rate of interest on safe government bonds and the rate of profit to the economy's growth rate. In the near-canonical model he presents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What he calls the \"partial-equilibrium\" transfer effect raises welfare if the rate on safe government bonds is less than the growth rate. \n",

    "\n",
    "Back up: Olivier Blanchard‘s presidential address has left me puzzled in one particular: I am not able to follow all his conclusions as to what interest rate should be used to discount the different effects of government debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blanchard considers a near-canonical model: the Diamond Overlapping Generations model. In this model, one important effect—perhaps the principal effect—of government debt is to directly shift consumption to the old who hold and sell the debt and away from the young who buy the debt to use it as a savings vehicle. I follow and agree with Blanchard’s correct conclusion that this direct-transfer effect can be welfare-raising or welfare-lowering. It will be welfare-raising as long as the economy is dynamically-inefficient, in that its safe rate of interest is less than its growth rate. So far, so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this near-canonical model, a second effect springs from government debt’s potential role in crowding-out capital investment. To the extent that it does so, and to the extent with that crowding-out raises profits received by old wealthholders and diminishes wages earned by younger workers, this second factor-price effect can also be welfare-raising or welfare-lowering. It will be welfare-raising, Blanchard concludes, only under a much stronger condition than that required for the direct-transfer effect: not just safe rate of interest on government bonds but the risky rate of profit on capital investment must be lower than the economy’s growth rate. And here, while I can follow Blanchard’s algebra—it certainly looks correct to me—I have a conceptual difficulty...\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is my conceptual difficulty in the case in which there is uncertainty and thus a gap between the risk-free interest rate at time t $ {R_{t+1}}^f $ and the expected profit rate $ E_t\\left[R_{t+1} \\right] $:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the utility values of the four cash flows associated with the direct-transfer and factor price effects:\n",
    "\n",
    ">(1) $ -E \\left[ U'(C_{y,t})dD \\right] $ :: the direct-transfer reduction in consumption when young because you purchases the rolled-over debt.\n",

    ">(3) $ E \\left[ U'(C_{y,t}dW_t \\right] $ :: the factor-price effect reduction in consumption (remember! $ \\frac{dW_t}{dD} < 0 $) when young because the reduced stock of capital lowers your bargaining power in the lavor market.\n",

    "My intuition tells me that the appropriate rate to discount the factor-price effect cannot be the expected risky profit rate, for to receive the higher profits when old you have not made a fixed investment but instead made something like a contribution to a social insurance scheme, and the utility cost of such a contribution is clearly lower than its expected value. Thus this factor-price effect might be a good deal even when it does not look not a profitable bargain from a what-is-the-risky-rate-of-profit? perspective.\n",
