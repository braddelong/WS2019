    "One major conclusion from Olivier Blanchard's excellent, thoughtful, and provocative American Economic Association Presidential Address \"Public Debt and Low Interest Rates\" <https://www.aeaweb.org/aea/2019conference/program/pdf/14020_paper_etZgfbDr.pdf> is that whether a marginal increase in public debt raise welfare—whether an economy is \"dynamically inefficient\" depends on the relationship of both rate of interest on safe government bonds and the rate of profit to the economy's growth rate. In the model he presents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What he calls the \"partial-equilibrium\" transfer effect raises welfare if the rate on safe government bonds is less than the growth rate. \n",
    "2. What he calls the \"general-equilbrium\" factor-price effect working through crowding-out raises the welfare of the average agent only when the risky profit rate is less than the growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "I may be being stupid here—my estimate of the chance I am being stupid is about 75%. But I have a conceptual problem here that I have been unable resolve...\n",

    "## <font color=\"880000\">My Conceptual Problem</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Back up: Olivier Blanchard‘s presidential address has left me puzzled in one particular: I am not able to follow all his conclusions as to what interest rate should be used to discount the different effects of government debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important effect—perhaps the principal effect—of government debt is to shift consumption to the old who hold and sell the debt and away from the young who buy the debt to use it as a savings vehicle. I follow and agree with Blanchard’s correct conclusion that this direct-transfer effect can be welfare-raising or welfare-lowering. It will be welfare-raising as long as the economy is dynamically-inefficient, in that its safe rate of interest is less than its growth rate. So far, so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second effect springs from government debt’s potential role in crowding-out capital investment. To the extent that it does so, and to the extent with that crowding-out raises profits received by old wealthholders and diminishes wages earned by younger workers, this second factor-price effect can also be welfare-raising or welfare-lowering. It will be welfare-raising, Blanchard concludes, only under a much stronger condition than that required for the direct-transfer effect: not just safe rate of interest on government bonds but the risky rate of profit on capital investment must be lower than the economy’s growth rate. And here, while I can follow Blanchard’s algebra—it certainly looks correct to me—I have a conceptual difficulty...\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is my conceptual difficulty: Consider three possible ways of shifting consumption from when you are young to when you are old:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Buying a government bond when young and selling it when you are old: the value of this is properly assessed using the risk-free safe interest-rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Investing in a risky enterprise when young and reaping the profits when old: you give up a known and fixed cash flow now and receive a risky cash flow later, so the value of this is properly assessed using the risky profit rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Social insurance–receiving a certain payment when old in return for a risky contribution when young correlated with your standard of living: the value of this is properly assessed using an “insurance” interest rate lower than the safe rate, because this scheme is a negative beta asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is very clear to me. The shift from (1) to (2) raises the appropriate rate at which to do the discounting; the shift from (1) to (3) lowers the appropriate rate at which to do the discounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a fourth way of shifting wealth from youth to age: a risky reduction in wages and earned when young balanced by a risky increase in profit received when old. **This is the factor-price effect in Blanchard’s model.** It seems clear to me that the appropriate rate is not the risky profit rate, for to receive higher profits you have not made a fixed investment but instead made something like a contribution to a social insurance scheme, and the utility cost of such a contribution is clearly lower than its expected value. Thus this effect might be a good deal even when it is not a profitable bargain from a what-is-the-risky-rate-of-profit? perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "My intuition tells me that if this factor-price affect is more like social insurance then the appropriate rate is lower than the safe rate, and if it is more like a capital investment then tiger appropriate interest rate is higher than the safe rate. My intuition tells me that it is in any case lower than the risky profit rate, and I see nothing in Blanchard's model to make it more like the one or the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I have found no flaw either in Blanchard’s algebra or in his modeling strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads me to expect that the reasoning behind my current visualization of the Cosmic All is in error.\n",
    "\n",
    "If anyone could teach me whether my thought is correct thought in accord with the Group of 17, and how to correct my thought to be in accord if it is not, I would be very grateful...\n",
