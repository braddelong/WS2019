    "Blanchard‘s extremely interesting, provocative, and masterly AEA presidential address concludes that the “general equilibrium“ effect of debt working through crowding-out and factor prices should be assessed at the average profit rate rather than the risk-free government bond rate. Because the value of the higher profit rate is correlated with consumption, it has a lower utility value and needs to be discounted more—hence discounted by the risky profit rate (remember: consumption when old is just profits, and so they are 100% correlated) when the value of higher profits when old is compared to the cost of lower wages when young.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Blanchard has, I think, missed is that in the uncertainy case wages received are also risky, and in the CARA case as risky as profits. The same discount from their expected value it needs to be applied to them. And when we apply this risk discount to both terms of the general equilibrium perfect and when we apply this risk discount to both terms of the general equilibrium effect— to both higher profits and lower wages— we get back to the conclusion that the right intertemporal discount rate to apply is the risk-free rate.\n",
