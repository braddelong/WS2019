    "Consider the effect of increasing and then rolling over government debt in a near-canonical model: the Diamond Overlapping-Generations model \n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, one important effect—perhaps the principal effect—of government debt is to directly shift consumption to the old who hold and sell the debt and away from the young who buy the debt to use it as a savings vehicle. I follow and agree with Blanchard’s correct conclusion that this direct-transfer effect can be welfare-raising or welfare-lowering. It will be welfare-raising as long as the economy is dynamically-inefficient, defined as having its safe rate of interest is less than its growth rate. So far, so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this near-canonical model, a second effect springs from government debt’s potential role in crowding-out capital investment. To the extent that it does so, and to the extent with that crowding-out raises profits received by old wealthholders and diminishes wages earned by younger workers, this second factor-price effect can also be welfare-raising or welfare-lowering as it transfers from the young, who earn less in wages, to the old, who pay less in wages when they hire people to work in their firms with their capital. It will be welfare-raising, Blanchard concludes in his presidential address, only under a stronger condition than that required for the direct-transfer effect: not just the safe rate of interest on government bonds but the risky rate of profit on capital investment must be lower than the economy’s growth rate.\n",

Also I have been playing a lot with oj.m the tiny MatLab program which simulates with Logarithmic utility, and Cobb Douglas production.\n",
    "\n",
    ">I think there is some interest in the point that these are different.  But I no longer think the difference is very dramatic.  One thing I've relearned is that Blanchard is very smart.  The answer to his question is much simpler than the answer to the slightly more interesting question of what happens to average welfare.  Also he has a very useful analogy -- the effects of reduced K on W and R are vaguely similar to the effects of a proportional (flat) tax wages with proceeds given to the old.  In each case, the amount a young person loses depens on the technology shock and is higher if the shock is good.  This means that I imagine a social insurance effect of taking less from poor generations (so did Brad).  But now I accept that the key variable is the average risky return.  I think this is what matters for the effect of the tax and transfer policy on average welfare too.\n",

He really used the tax and transfer analogy which is mentioned then dropped in his final text.\n",

Even for constant alpha and beta, the expected return on capital will vary as K varies, but (for that very special case) the key number for all generations is the return on average capital used with average technology.\n",

    "Read the first e-mail first (not that it is necessarily worth working through all the ascii algebra in it).  I can't help typing more.  following \" Blanchard's problem is that fixed D crowds out a fixed amount of capital not a fixed fraction of the capital.  This means that the effect of increased debt D on log(wages) and returns on capital depends on K_t .  Wages aren't reduced by a fixed proportion of wages.  This creates social insurance effects. This means that we sort of have a point.  But it is all kind of second order.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "OK so the point (if any) is that fixed debt D doesn't cause K_t to decline by a constant proportion. Rather, given K_t and A_t fixed debt crowds out a fixed amount D of capital reducing K_(t+1) by D not multiplying it by a number less than 1.  Above I argued that key to understanding of a payroll tax and transfer on weflare is (R-1) where R is the return on an average capital stock used with average technology.  That works also for changes in W and R, provided the reduction of W is a constant fraction of W.  That would be true for a constant elasticity of substitution production function if the reduction of K is a fixed proportion of K.  But it isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matters for two reasons, both of which are a bit like social insurance (neither applies to workers who work with average K using average technology). \n",
    "1) if the workers young at time t are unlucky because they are hit by a bad technology shock (low A) then fixed D is good for them, because a) they will also be poor when they are old  because K_(t+1) will be low and b) crowding out by debt. has a big effect on R_(t+1) because K_(t+1) is low.  This is good for average welfare.  A big positive effect on R for old generations with low K reduces the variance of consumption when old if other things are equal (longer argument below if anyone is interested)\n",
    "2) but other things aren't.  The fixed amont of crowding out will reduce the mean of K more than it reduces the standard deviation of K, so it increases the coefficient of variation of K. This is bad for expected welfare.  One way of seeing this is to think of generation young at t+1 when A_t is low.  They are poor even if A_(t+1) is average, because K_(t+1) is low.  Debt will have a  big proportional effect on their wages, because K_(t+1) is low. (again longer argument below if anyone is interested).\n",
    "\n",
    "In simulations the good effect 1) is bigger than the bad effect 2) because the welfare of generation t depends a lot on A_t and not so much on K_t which doesn't vary so much.  However, first this isn't a dramatic result even in the special case and second I fear it depends on the particular assumptions of log utility, Cobb-Douglas production,  share of labor of around 0.67 and saving about half of labor income.  (a third time more on this below if anyone is interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there is something there about how the effect on average welfare is different than the effect on welfare of a generation which uses an average amount of capital with average technology.  But it isn't as dramatic as I expected.\n",

    "long boring version of point 1)\n",
    "This really is analysis of the welfare of a generation which works with the average amound of capital K but using stochastic technology A_t.  \n",
    "a) The argument requires that if A_t is low then K_(t+1) will be low.  This a natural assumption.  It is certainly true for logarithmic utility.  It is, of course, possible to assume weird utility and production functions so it isn't true.  \n",
    "b) it also requires that low K causes low capital income. This is true for a Cobb-Douglas production function, but it isn't true if capital and labor are very poor substitutes so the elasticity of demand for capital is greater than 1 in absolute value.   It's a reasonable assumption, but the claim isn't universal.\n",
    "c) finally it requires that low K implies a large effect of reduction in K on R.  This is true of functions with a constant elasticity of substitution of capital and labor. It isn't true of all concave CRS production functions.\n",
    "\n",
    " long boring version of point 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of thinking about this is to note that low A_t is bad for the generation young in period t+1, because they don't have much capital to work with.  compared to a fixed percent reduction in K, fixed D makes this worse for them, because it causes a proportionally large reduction in K_(t+1).  More generally, this also means that (compared to a fixed proportional reduction in K, D increases the harm due to low A_(t-1), A_(t-2) etc.  The simple way of summing up these costs is what I wrote above. For the same reduction in average K, fixed D causes a smaller reduction in the variance of K than a fixed proportional reduction in K.  The higher (in the fixed D case) variance causes a lower average of welfare across generations.  This is a social (anti)insurance effect which matters for average welfare but not for the welfare of workers who work with the average amount of capital.\n",
