    "Consider a near-canonical model: the Diamond Overlapping-Generations model \n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, one important effect—perhaps the principal effect—of government debt is to directly shift consumption to the old who hold and sell the debt and away from the young who buy the debt to use it as a savings vehicle. I follow and agree with Blanchard’s correct conclusion that this direct-transfer effect can be welfare-raising or welfare-lowering. It will be welfare-raising as long as the economy is dynamically-inefficient, in that its safe rate of interest is less than its growth rate. So far, so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this near-canonical model, a second effect springs from government debt’s potential role in crowding-out capital investment. To the extent that it does so, and to the extent with that crowding-out raises profits received by old wealthholders and diminishes wages earned by younger workers, this second factor-price effect can also be welfare-raising or welfare-lowering as it transfers from the young, who earn less in wages, to the old, who pay less in wages when they hire people to work in their firms with their capital. It will be welfare-raising, Blanchard concludes, only under a stronger condition than that required for the direct-transfer effect: not just the safe rate of interest on government bonds but the risky rate of profit on capital investment must be lower than the economy’s growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me set out a simple case, with neither population growth nor technological progressm with log utility, and with uncertainty and thus a wedge begtween the expected profit rate and the safe government bond rate generated by a shock to productivity in each period that can take on two values: the productivity of capital in period t can be, with 50% probability for each, either $ R_t = (1 + \\epsilon_t)R(K_t) $ or R_t = (1 - \\epsilon_t)R(K_t) $.\n",
